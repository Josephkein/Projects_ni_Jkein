        <h1 class="Aname">I'm <h1 class="Aname1">Joseph Kein Honrada</h1></h1>
        <p class="Ap">I am a 17-year-old first-year college student at Southern Leyte State University,
                      pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a Major in
                      Programming. I have a strong desire to become a professional programmer,
                      focusing on web development or software engineering. Apart from studying,
                      I enjoy playing online games and watching anime. In my earlier years, I
                      attended Lunang Elementary School before graduating from Bato Institute of
                      Science and Technology Inc. with the STEM strand and achieving high honors.
                      Throughout my academic journey, achieving high honors in senior high school
                      further fueled my dedication to academic excellence. Despite my fondness for
                      good food, I diligently saved money for my dream computer setup. Standing
                      at 5'7" with a slender physique, my favorite color is sky blue.<br><br>

                      I have acquired foundational skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which
                      I continue to develop. During the pandemic, I also contributed as a lyrics editor,
                      showcasing my attention to detail and creativity.<br><br>
            
                      Personally, I prefer a girlfriend who's shorter than me, cute, does well in school,
                      and is independent. That's why I'm lucky to have found Jennelyn A. Brigoli from
                      Kalanggaman, Bato Leyte, who is my dream girl and already my girlfriend. My
                      goal is to succeed in my career so I can travel and make memories with her and
                      with my family.</p>
