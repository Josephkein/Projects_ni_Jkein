        <p class="Ap">I am a 17-year-old first-year college student at Southern Leyte State University,<br>
                      pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a Major in<br>
                      Programming. I have a strong desire to become a professional programmer,<br>
                      focusing on web development or software engineering. Apart from studying,<br>
                      I enjoy playing online games and watching anime. In my earlier years, I<br>
                      attended Lunang Elementary School before graduating from Bato Institute of<br>
                      Science and Technology Inc. with the STEM strand and achieving high honors.<br>
                      Throughout my academic journey, achieving high honors in senior high school<br>
                      further fueled my dedication to academic excellence. Despite my fondness for<br>
                      good food, I diligently saved money for my dream computer setup. Standing<br>
                      at 5'7" with a slender physique, my favorite color is sky blue.<br><br>

                      I have acquired foundational skills in C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which<br>
                      I continue to develop. During the pandemic, I also contributed as a lyrics editor,<br>
                      showcasing my attention to detail and creativity.<br><br>
            
                      Personally, I prefer a girlfriend who's shorter than me, cute, does well in school,<br>
                      and is independent. That's why I'm lucky to have found Jennelyn A. Brigoli from<br>
                      Kalanggaman, Bato Leyte, who is my dream girl and already my girlfriend. My<br>
                      goal is to succeed in my career so I can travel and make memories with her and<br>
                      with my family.</p>
